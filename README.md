# tuna


## About Me
My name is Daniel, and this is my first time using GitHub. Through this project, I hope to hone my approach to data science problems and to become more technically literate in the tools used to share my findings.

## About Repository
This repository is to document my explorations of WCPFC data to validate industry assumptions and to identify key indicators of underreported catch of longline tuna.
